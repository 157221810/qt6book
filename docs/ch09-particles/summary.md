# Summary

Particles are a very powerful and fun way to express graphical phenomena like smoke. firework, random visual elements. The extended API in Qt 5 is very powerful and we have just scratched the surface. There are several elements we havenâ€™t yet played with like sprites, size tables or color tables. Also when the particles look very playful they have a great potential when used wisely to create some eye catcher in any user interface. Using too many particle effects inside a user interface will definitely lead to the impression towards a game. Creating games is also the real strength of the particles.
