# Particle Simulations

Particles are a computer graphics techniques to visualize certain graphics effects. Typical effects could be falling leaves, fire, explosions, meteors, clouds, etc.

It differs from other graphics rendering as particles rendering is based on fuzzy aspects. The outcome is not exactly predictable on pixel-base. Parameters to the particle system describe the boundaries for the stochastic simulation. The phenomena rendered with particles is often difficult to visualize with traditional rendering techniques. The good thing is you can let QML elements interact with the particles systems. Also as parameters are expressed as properties they can be animated using the traditional animation techniques.
