# Qt and QtQuick

This book provides you with a walk through of the different aspects of application development using Qt 5.12. It focuses on the new Qt Quick technology, but also provides necessary information about writing C++ back-ends and extension for Qt Quick.

This chapter provides a high-level overview of Qt 5. It shows the different application models available for developers, as well as a Qt 5 showcase application, as a sneak preview of things to come. Additionally, the chapter aims to provide a wide overview of the Qt 5 content and how to get in touch with the makers of Qt 5.


## History

Qt 4 has evolved since 2005 and provided a solid ground for thousands of applications and even full desktop and mobile systems. The usage patterns of computer users changed in the recent years. From stationary PCs towards portable notebook and nowadays mobile computers. The classical desktop is more and more replaced with mobile touch-based always connected screens. With it, the desktop UX paradigms also change. Whereas in the past Windows UI has dominated the world we spend more time nowadays on other screens with another UI language.

Qt 4 was designed to satisfy the desktop world to have a coherent set of UI widgets available on all major platforms. The challenge for Qt users has changed today and it lies more to provide a touch-based user interface for a customer-driven user interface and to enable modern user interface on all major desktop and mobile systems. Qt 4.7 started to introduce the Qt Quick technology which allows users to create a set of user interface components from simple elements to achieve a completely new UI, driven by customer demands.

## Qt 5 Focus

Qt 5 is a complete refreshing of the very successful Qt 4 release. With Qt 4.8, the Qt 4 release is almost 7 years old. Itâ€™s time to make an amazing toolkit even more amazing. Qt 5 is focused on the following:


* **Outstanding Graphics**: Qt Quick 2 is based on OpenGL (ES) using a scene graph implementation. The recomposed graphics stack allows a new level of graphics effects combined with an ease of use never seen before in this field.


* **Developer Productivity**: QML and JavaScript are the primary means for UI creation. The back-end will be driven by C++. The split between JavaScript and C++ allows a fast iteration for front-end developers concentrating on creating beautiful user interfaces and back-end C++ developers concentrating on stability, performance and extending the runtime.


* **Cross-platform portability**: With the consolidated Qt Platform Abstraction, it is now possible to port Qt to a wider range of platforms easier and faster. Qt 5 is structured around the concept of Qt Essentials and Add-ons, which allows OS developer to focus on the essentials modules and leads to a smaller runtime altogether.


* **Open Development**: Qt is now a truly open-governance project hosted at [qt.io](http://qt.io). The development is open and community driven.
