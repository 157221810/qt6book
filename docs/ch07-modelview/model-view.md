# Model-View-Delegate

In Qt Quick, data is separated from the presentation through a model-view separation. For each view, the visualization of each data element is separated into a delegate. Qt Quick comes with a set of predefined models and views. To utilize the system, one must understand these classes and know how to create appropriate delegates to get the right look and feel.
