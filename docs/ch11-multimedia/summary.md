# Summary

The media API provided by Qt provides mechanisms for playing and capturing video and audio. Through the `VideoOutput` element and video, the source can be displayed in the user interface. Through the `MediaPlayer` element, most playback can be handled, even though the `SoundEffect` can be used for low-latency sounds. For capturing, or only showing a live video stream, the `Camera` element is used.
