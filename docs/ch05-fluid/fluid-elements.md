# Fluid Elements

Till now, we have mostly looked at some simple graphical elements and how to arrange and manipulate them. 

This chapter is about how to control these changes in a way that a value of a property not just changes instantly, itâ€™s more how the value changes over time: an animation. 

Animations are one of the key foundations for modern slick user interfaces and can be described for your user interface using states, transitions and animations. Each state defines a set of property changes and can be combined with animations on state changes. These changes are described as a transition from one state to another state.

Besides animations are used during transitions they also can be used as standalone elements triggered by some scripted events.
