# Fluid Elements

Till now, we have mostly looked at simple graphical elements and how to arrange and manipulate them. This chapter is about how to control these changes in a way that a value of a property not just changes instantly, itâ€™s more how the value changes over time: an animation. This technology is one of the key foundations for modern slick user interfaces and can be extended with a system to describe your user interface using states and transitions. Each state defines a set of property changes and can be combined with animations on state changes, called transitions.
