# Debugging

Qt Creator comes with C++ and QML debugging support.

::: tip
Hmm, I just realized I have not used debugging a lot. I hope this is a good sign. Need to ask someone to help me out here. In the meantime have a look at the [Qt Creator documentation](http://http://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/index.html).
